# Vegetation Mapping Code Samples

Sample code from my work at CSIRO on continental-scale vegetation monitoring and wildfire intelligence systems.

## Spinifex Classification (Python)
Deep learning pipeline for fuel type mapping from high-resolution aerial imagery. Demonstrates:
- Large-scale geospatial processing (3GB+ images)
- PyTorch semantic segmentation
- Memory-efficient tiling and batch processing
- Production deployment at scale

## Individual Tree Detection (R)
LiDAR processing pipeline for forest structure mapping across Australia. Demonstrates:
- HPC parallel processing (200-node scaling)
- Vegetation-specific algorithm selection
- Continental-scale operational deployment
- Robust error handling for production systems

Both pipelines represent operational systems currently used for Australia's National Bushfire Intelligence Capability and vegetation structure mapping projects.
